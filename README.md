### General info
This project is a web blog, made in Python using the Django framework. It was created for the basics of programming classes.
After logging in, you can create posts, edit and delete them. While an ordinary user without logging in has the option viewing posts and reading them.
This is a group project, in which I created the entire backend. The blog also has a search engine thanks to which you can find posts that interest you.
The last posts are shown on the left and the posts in the order they were added are listed in the middle.
Each post has the date of adding and the author of the post, along with the avatar.
Posts also have tags that can be specified when creating or editing them. Each post can have various formatting, images and thumbnail.
After clicking the menu icon on the right, we can log in. After logging in, there is an option to create a post and an inscription saying that we are logged in
with user's name, and if we press this inscription, we will be taken to the administrator menu, where we can add authors, posts, groups, grant permissions, etc.
